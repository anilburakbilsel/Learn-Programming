## Learn Programming
In this repo, I will be posting usefull resources on how to learn programming. 

I will try to update this repository as much as possible.

### The Languages:

#### TypeScript (Right now, there are two different TypeScript files, you can read both of  them, I guarantee you that by carefully reading those two TS files, you will learn a lot about TypeScript.)

And here is another link (a very good video) that shows you how to use the debugger in 
Visual Studio Code for your TypeScript projects, the video also explains you how to create a local-hosts to test your websites or online applications:

#### JSON

JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is a standard text-based format for representing structured data 
based on JavaScript object syntax. It is commonly used for transmitting data in web applications (e.g., 
sending some data from the server to the client, so it can be displayed on a web page, or vice versa).
