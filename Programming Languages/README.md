# Some Important Points in Programming:

### 4 main concepts of Object Oriented Programming are:

Abstraction
Encapsulation
Inheritance
Polymorphism


### Pointer:
A pointer is a variable that contains an address of a variable.

A pointer references a location in memory, and obtaining the value stored at that location is known as dereferencing the pointer.

As an anology, a page number in a book's index could be considered a pointer to the corresponding page; dereferencing such a pointer would be done by flipping to the page with the given page number and reading th text found on the indexed page.
