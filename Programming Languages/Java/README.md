There are 3 types of variables in Java:
1-) Local Variable
2-) Static (or Class) Variable
3-) Instance Variable

Static (or Class) variables are associated with the class and common for all the instances of class. For example, if I create three objects of a class and access this static variable, it would be common for all, the changes made to the variable using one of the object would reflect when you access it through other objects.
