// Each time a new object is created, at least one constructor will be invoked. The main rule of constructors is that they should have the 
//same name as the class. A class can have more than one constructor.

// Instance Variables: instance variables are variables within a class but outside any method. these variables are initialized when the class is instantiated.
//                     instance variables can be accessed from inside any method, constructor, or blocks of that particular class. 

// Class Variables:    class variables are variables declared within a class, outside any method, with the static keyword.
